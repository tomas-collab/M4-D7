React Hooks
In today's homework you'll apply your new skills on the Strivebooks project, converting every Class Component into a Functional one with Hooks!
Start from your existing Strivebooks project. If you want to start fresh with a clean slate, you can clone this repo to get started: https://github.com/irvelervel/m4-d6-hw

HINTS
Use useState() and useEffect() to mimic Class Component capabilities.
Remember that useEffect() can be used like componentDidMount as well as componentDidUpdate, depending on what you put on its dependency array.
Try to mantain the values for the input fields in AddComment in a single object, using just one useState() for the whole form.
